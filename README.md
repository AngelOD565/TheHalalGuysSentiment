# TheHalalGuysSentiment

Sentiment analysis of one of my favorite restaurants (The Halal Guys) using a BERT transformer. This project is a data pipeline which you can feed any restaurant on Yelp, and it will create a dataframe of the comments and pass the comments into the BERT transformer and calculate a sentiment score from 1-5 for each comment.
